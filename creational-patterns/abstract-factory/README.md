# Abstract Factory - a factory of factories

## Objectives
- Provide a new layer of encapsulation for Factory methods that return a common interface for all factories
- Group common factories into a super Factory (also called a factory of factories)

## Note
- We are going to use the same use case used to show ``builder pattern``
